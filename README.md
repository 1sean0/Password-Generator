# Password Generator

## Overview
This is a **secure and customizable password generator** built using **Python and Tkinter**. It allows users to generate strong passwords with various constraints, save them with labels for better organization, and exclude specific characters based on their preferences. The program also provides real-time feedback on password strength.

## Features
- **Welcome Page**: A user-friendly start screen with options to begin or exit the application.
- **Password Generation**: Users can generate random passwords based on customizable constraints.
- **Labeling System**: Save passwords with descriptive labels (e.g., "Email", "Bank Account").
- **Exclusion Options**: Users can exclude similar-looking characters (e.g., `I`, `l`, `O`, `0`) or specify custom characters to be omitted.
- **Constraint Validation**: Prevents users from exceeding the total password length with constraints, displaying an error message instead of crashing.
- **Password Strength Indicator**: Provides real-time feedback on password strength (Weak, Medium, Strong).
- **Save to File**: Generated passwords can be saved to a text file for easy retrieval.
